# Unit 6: Python APIs

## Overview

This unit, we will cover the use of third-party APIs with Python. We’ll programmatically obtain and parse data from sources such as OpenWeatherMap, the U.S. Census, OMDb, and more. We will also plot DataFrames from the API data using Matplotlib.

## Objectives

* Make `get` requests with the Request library.

* Convert JSON into a Python dictionary.

* Read and apply API documentation.

* Sign up for and use an API key.

* Create applications from scratch by using nothing but their knowledge of Python and an API’s documentation.

* Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors.

* Use the Geoapify API to obtain information about geographic areas.

* Use the Census API wrapper.

* Explain  the concept of rate limits and the importance of creating test cases before running large scripts.

* Dissect new API documentation.

* Visually represent data on a map with Jupyter Gmaps.
